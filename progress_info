# Level 1
Implementation is complete

# Level 2
1) Add a Makefile or your preferred build scripting to build and test the solution
   Used github actions with a local runner, this is called act, the project can be found here
   https://github.com/nektos/act

2) Add some tests, test for corner cases or unexpected behaviour
   Didn't get to this - would be great for production

3) Add the ability to detect a port scan, where a single source IP connects to more than 3 host ports in the previous minute
   Rougly implemented this, will need more work

# Level 3
1) Add a prometheus endpoint to report metrics 
   Completed

2) Build the project into a docker container, provide instructions on how to execute as a container while reporting connections on the host.
   Completed

3) When a port scan is detected, configure the host firewall to block connections by source-ip.
