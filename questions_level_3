#Â If you had to deploy this program to hundreds of servers, what would be your preferred method? Why?
I would say either ansible or salt, i would tend towards ansible because i'm more familiar with it.
I would say that it's useful as it's agentless so there is no dependency on having to have an agent installed on the remote end.

# What is the hardest technical problem or outage you've had to solve in your career? Explain what made it so difficult?
I'd have to say working on what was supposed to be a simple terraform migration.
The issue was the change in the terraform state data structure from 0.11.x to 0.12.x

There was an operations system that was used for support on k8s clusters and cloud infrastructure platforms, all the libraries that were used in this platform expected the data in a specific format, after the upgrade this ceased to function correctly due to the change in the data structure.

This resulted in spending a number of months refactoring the libraries with very little documentation or team knowledge of how the libraries and system functioned.

Very challenging to say the least, but, i did get to read and write a fair amount of code which was great!
